![MiniOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datkat21/MiniOS/master/Assets/miniosLogo_readme.png)
<br>
A simple C#/XAML "OS" created in Visual Studio.
Created as a tribute to my old project with the same name that got lost due to a hard drive wipe.


## Why call it an OS?

I call it that because it's similar to Windows in a way and it's like my own mini "OS".

## Features

- ###  Window system
